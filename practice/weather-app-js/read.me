Just coping some random code on github to practice.

With a lot of time away from code, a renembered about :hover and :focus and was nice.

Somethings about fonts was good to renember to, like the shadows.

I haven't been able to get it yet, it looks like the API was not authorized to query. I need to understand this better in the future...
