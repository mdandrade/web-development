I will practice more JavaScript here with this game.

I want improve some concepts, like: 

createElement()
forEach()
setInterval()
clearInterval()
removeChild()
appendChild()
addEventListener()
removeEventListener()

I'm just copying, bacause i guess that this is the best way to learn, yet. Of course, before a can make my own complex project's.
